Welcome to the CLI documentation of Cobbler!
============================================

This is the new documentation of the Cobbler CLI. It is written in Go and uses the `Cobra <https://github.com/spf13/cobra>`_
library for the user interaction and the `Cobblerclient <https://github.com/cobbler/cobblerclient>`_ library for the
communication with a Cobbler server.
